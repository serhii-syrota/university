= Deep learning

/ Def: techniques for machine learning in which hypothesis takes form of complex algebraic circuits with tunable connection strength.

/ Deep: means that circuits organized into layers.

/ Neural networks: models trained with deep learning.

== Comparison to default regression algorithms

Linear and logistic regression features path to output is very short "f*coef -> aggregation res". The features contributes independently without interaction with each other.
