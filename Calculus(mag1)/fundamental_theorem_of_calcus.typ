/ Purpose: link the concept of *differentiating*(calculating its slopes or rate of change at each time) a function with the concept of *integrating*(calculating the area under its graph, or the cumulative effect of small contributions) a function.

$ f(a) - f(b) = integral_(a)^(b)f'(t)d(t) $

// TODO purpose of differentiating and integrating
// TODO 1, 2 states of theorem
