## Requirements to Mobile Development project 1 - "List sort & visualize"

### User story

1. Imagine that you are person, who works with numbers, for example sales manager. In the end of financial quarter you must report to CEO about state of sale statistics and you accidentally put some water on notebook where was your presentation about customers age, but you have on phone report presented in list of numbers (e.g: 23,42,12...), but CEO have no time to read all list. For create histogram you decided to find app, that can visualize list of number and voil√†!

2. Another example. Imagine that you have animal care job and there are task to feed animals in sorted IRL aviaries. But your coworker send to your phone not sorted list of aviaries ID's. So you decided to find mobile app, that sort's lists and reports most suitable sorting algorithm, you want in future update your zoo CMS, to automatically sort feed request aviaries ID's.

### The Project Scope

1. List input from:

   - keyboard
     - input list should have exporting ability to json file
   - stored json file, that contains array of numbers(e.g `[1.0, 2.1,3.01]` etc.)

2. List output:

   - Elements histogram
   - Sorted list
   - For each sorting algorithm(which count is 5) iterations count
   - Most effective sorting algorithm from presented

3. Developer page contains:
   - photo
   - developer name and group
   - few contacts
