Great job on completing the assessment! You've provided thoughtful answers to each question. Below, I'll review each of your responses, offer feedback, and point out any areas where there might be errors or room for improvement.

### **1. What Linear Regression training algorithm can you use if you have a training set with millions of features?**

**Your Answer:**

> _Stochastic gradient descent_

**Feedback:**

You're correct! When dealing with a large number of features (or a large dataset), **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** is a suitable algorithm for training Linear Regression models. SGD updates the model parameters incrementally, which makes it computationally efficient for large-scale problems where using the Normal Equation or Batch Gradient Descent would be infeasible due to high computational costs and memory requirements.

---

### **2. Suppose the features in your training set have very different scales. What algorithms might suffer from this, and how? What can you do about it?**

**Your Answer:**

> \*We overviewed the linear regression, binary and multiple classification and logistic binary and multiple classifiers, the linear regression.
>
> The problem is that some classifiers may rely on Euclidean distance and when we have a large-scale feature - model can be biased to it.
>
> It’s important to apply normalization if model has regularization, to eliminate bias to large-scale weight.
>
> We can normalize features to fix this problem. Using min-max(0-1) or standardization\*

**Feedback:**

Excellent explanation! Algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of features include:

- **Gradient Descent-based algorithms**: If features have different scales, the cost function can become elongated along certain dimensions, making convergence slow or causing the algorithm to oscillate.
- **Algorithms relying on distance metrics** (e.g., **k-Nearest Neighbors**, **Support Vector Machines** with RBF kernel): Features with larger scales can dominate the distance calculations, skewing the results.

You're also right about the solution: **Feature scaling** (normalization or standardization) helps these algorithms perform better by ensuring all features contribute equally to the result.

### **3. Can Gradient Descent get stuck in a local minimum when training a Logistic Regression model?**

**Your Answer:**

> _No, the loss function is convex, so SGD is guaranteed to find the global minimum._

**Feedback:**

Correct! The loss function for Logistic Regression (specifically, the cost function with respect to the parameters) is **convex**, which means it has a single global minimum. Therefore, **Gradient Descent** algorithms, including **Stochastic Gradient Descent**, will converge to the global minimum and won't get stuck in local minima.

---

### **4. Do all Gradient Descent algorithms lead to the same model provided you let them run long enough?**

**Your Answer:**

> _Not all, the stochastic may be near global minimum because of its “large step”_

**Feedback:**

You're on the right track. While **Batch Gradient Descent** will converge to the exact global minimum for convex problems (given a sufficiently small learning rate and enough time), **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** and **Mini-batch Gradient Descent** introduce randomness because they use subsets of data to compute gradients.

As a result, **SGD** might not settle at the exact global minimum but will hover around it due to its stochastic nature. To mitigate this, you can reduce the learning rate over time (learning rate decay), which helps SGD converge more closely to the global minimum.

### **5. Suppose you use Batch Gradient Descent and you plot the validation error at every epoch. If you notice that the validation error consistently goes up, what is likely going on? How can you fix this?**

**Your Answer:**

> \*The possible problem is that the model overfits the dataset.
>
> Provide more data.
>
> Use techniques (for example, stratification) to divide the dataset into representative train and validation subsets.\*

**Feedback:**

Good observation. However, if the **validation error is increasing while the training error decreases**, it's typically a sign of **overfitting**, where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and doesn't generalize to new data.

To fix this:

1. **Regularization**: Apply techniques like **Ridge Regression** or **Lasso Regression** to penalize large coefficients and simplify the model.
2. **Simplify the Model**: Reduce the model complexity by selecting fewer features or decreasing the polynomial degree if using polynomial regression.
3. **Early Stopping**: Monitor the validation error during training and stop training when it starts to increase.
4. **Gather More Data**: More training data can help the model generalize better.
5. **Cross-Validation**: Ensure your data splitting method (like stratified sampling) correctly represents the data distribution.

Your suggestion about data division is relevant—ensuring that the training and validation sets are representative can help, but the primary issue is likely model complexity and overfitting.

### **6. Is it a good idea to stop Mini-batch Gradient Descent immediately when the validation error goes up?**

**Your Answer:**

> _Maybe it’s just a local outline (outlier), it’s feasible to remember this state, then go through several next steps, and if the error continues to go up, then stop at the best-remembered state._

**Feedback:**

You're correct. **Immediately stopping** when the validation error goes up might not be the best idea due to possible fluctuations, especially with **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**, where the validation error can occasionally increase due to the mini-batch stochasticity.

A better approach is to implement **Early Stopping**:

- **Monitor the validation error** over several epochs.
- **Patience**: Allow the model to train for a few more epochs to see if the validation error decreases again.
- **Best Model Checkpointing**: Keep track of the model parameters that achieved the lowest validation error and revert to them if the error doesn't improve.

### **7. Which Gradient Descent algorithm (among those we discussed) will reach the vicinity of the optimal solution the fastest? Which will actually converge? How can you make the others converge as well?**

**Your Answer:**

> _Fastest - stochastic gradient descent. Full-dataset gradient descent would converge. We can refine SGD and mini-batch by decreasing learning rate with the iterations count._

**Feedback:**

Well done!

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** often reaches the vicinity of the optimal solution faster because it makes frequent updates with each training example, which allows it to move quickly through the parameter space.
- **Batch Gradient Descent** will converge to the global minimum in convex problems because it uses all data to compute the gradients, leading to stable steps.

To help **SGD** and **Mini-batch Gradient Descent** converge:

- **Learning Rate Decay**: Gradually reduce the learning rate over time.
- **Momentum**: Use momentum-based optimization to dampen oscillations.
- **Advanced Optimizers**: Employ optimizers like **Adam** or **RMSprop** that adapt the learning rate during training.

### **8. Suppose you are using Polynomial Regression. You plot the learning curves and you notice that there is a large gap between the training error and the validation error. What is happening? What are three ways to solve this?**

**Your Answer:**

> \*Model is overfitted to the training dataset.
>
> We may use regularization of the model.
>
> Also, overfitting may be caused due to non-representative division, so we need to make them representative.
>
> Reduce polynomial features count, from x^4 to x^2 for example.\*

**Feedback:**

You're right that a large gap between training and validation error indicates **overfitting**. The model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

Three ways to address overfitting are:

1. **Simplify the Model**: Reduce the degree of the polynomial to decrease complexity.
2. **Regularization**: Apply techniques like Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression to penalize large coefficients.
3. **Increase Training Data**: More data can help the model generalize better.

Ensuring that your data splits are representative (e.g., through stratified sampling) is also important, but the primary issue here is model complexity.

### **9. Suppose you are using Ridge Regression and you notice that the training error and the validation error are almost equal and fairly high. Would you say that the model suffers from high bias or high variance? Should you increase the regularization hyperparameter α or reduce it?**

**Your Answer:**

> _I would say that the model suffers from variance problem and try to make alpha lower_

**Feedback:**

This is a common point of confusion, so let's clarify:

- If **training error is high** and **similar to validation error**, the model is **underfitting** the data, which is a sign of **high bias**.
- **High bias** means the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns.

To address high bias:

- **Reduce the regularization hyperparameter α**: A large α adds too much penalty to the model coefficients, simplifying the model excessively.
- **Increase model complexity**: Use more features or a more complex model that can capture the data patterns.

So, you're correct in suggesting that α should be reduced, but the issue is **high bias**, not **high variance**.

### **10. Why would you want to use:**

#### **• Ridge Regression instead of plain Linear Regression (i.e., without any regularization)?**

**Your Answer:**

> _For polynomial regression or for linear regression when the model is overfitting data._

#### **• Lasso instead of Ridge Regression?**

**Your Answer:**

> _Lasso instead of Ridge to eliminate useless features completely._

#### **• Elastic Net instead of Lasso?**

**Your Answer:**

> _Elastic Net to have a mix of two regularizations and let the model be more flexible. It can eliminate some features but also it could “push” some large-impact features like Ridge does._

**Feedback:**

Your answers are spot-on!

- **Ridge Regression**: Used when you want to reduce **overfitting** by adding an L2 penalty term that shrinks coefficients but doesn't eliminate them. It's helpful when all features may be relevant but you want to reduce their impact.

- **Lasso Regression**: Preferred when you suspect that only a few features are important. The L1 penalty can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing **feature selection**.

- **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 and L2 penalties, making it useful when you have many correlated features. It balances the feature selection of Lasso with the coefficient shrinking of Ridge, providing flexibility.

### **11. Suppose you want to classify pictures as outdoor/indoor and daytime/nighttime. Should you implement two Logistic Regression classifiers or one Softmax Regression classifier?**

**Your Answer:**

> _I can use softmax with four classes_

**Feedback:**

In this scenario, it's better to implement **two Logistic Regression classifiers**, not one Softmax Regression classifier. Here's why:

- **Two Independent Binary Classifications**: The attributes **outdoor/indoor** and **daytime/nighttime** are **independent binary labels**. Each image can be:

  - Outdoor & Daytime
  - Outdoor & Nighttime
  - Indoor & Daytime
  - Indoor & Nighttime

- **Softmax Regression** (Multinomial Logistic Regression) is suitable for **multi-class classification** where classes are **mutually exclusive** (an instance belongs to only one class).

- **Multi-label Classification**: Since images can belong to more than one class (e.g., outdoor and daytime), you need **two separate binary classifiers** to handle each label independently.

**Revised Approach:**

- Implement **two Logistic Regression classifiers**:

  1. **Classifier 1**: Predicts **outdoor (1)** vs. **indoor (0)**.
  2. **Classifier 2**: Predicts **daytime (1)** vs. **nighttime (0)**.

This approach allows for all combinations of labels and handles the multi-label nature of the problem effectively.

---

**Overall, you've demonstrated a good understanding of the concepts.** For questions 9 and 11, be mindful of the distinctions between high bias and high variance, and when to use binary classifiers versus multi-class classifiers.

Keep up the great work in your machine learning studies!
